# Catena-X Knowledge Agents (Hey Catena!) Agent Sources

This is a folder providing FOSS implementations of Hey Catena! agents that may be used in conjunction with the extended Eclipse Dataspace Connector.

We provide three implementations for different profiles

- [Matchmaking/Inference Agent](matchmaking) An agent implementation for consumer-side deployment which will just delegate/federate skills.
- [Provisioning Agent](provisioning) An agent implementation for provider-side deployment which will bind typical backend data sources to the dataspace.
- [Remoting Agent](remoting) An agent implementation for binding simple remote (REST) services to the dataspace.
