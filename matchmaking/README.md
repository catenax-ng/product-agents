# Catena-X Knowledge Agents (Hey Catena!) Matchmaking and Inference Agent

This is a folder providing a FOSS implementations of a Hey Catena! agent for consumer-side deployment which will just delegate/federate skills.

Currently, a plain Apache Jena Fuseki is used for federation (no matchmaking). This will change in the near future and this folder will become active.
