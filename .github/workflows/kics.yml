# Take out 
#   - the "Always" Image Pull Policy Rule (caa3479d-885d-4882-9aac-95e5e78ef5c2) because depending on the deployment/rollout scenarios, other policies are more reasonable.
#   - the "LimitRange" Namespace Rule (4a20ebac-1060-4c81-95d1-1f7f620e983b) because the target namespace may define that external to the Chart.
#   - the "ResourceQuota" Namespace Rule (48a5beba-e4c0-4584-a2aa-e6894e4cf424) because the target namespace may define that external to the Chart.
